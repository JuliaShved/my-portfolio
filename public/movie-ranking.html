<h2>Why?</h2>
<h3>How to train your dragon</h3>
<p>I gave it 5 stars because realy cool imagination, And the author did a nice job on art.</p>
<h3>rise of the Guardians</h3>
<p> I gave it 4 stars because kids would realy enjoy it %100, But it is not real.</p>
<h3>The lion king</h3>
<p>Sadly I gave it 2 stars because it is an old movie and %99 of people know it. and more than 112 million people watched it.</p>
